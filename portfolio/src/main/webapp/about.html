            <div>
                I am a rising senior (year 4) in a five-year
                program at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, 
                majoring in Industrial and Systems Engineering with 
                a minor in Computer Science.</div>
            <div> 
                From having no clue what I wanted to do with my life 
                and switching between Vocal Performance, Chemical Engineering,
                and Mathematics, my ultimate calling lies in:</div>
            <ol class="roman-list">
                <li>Creating and designing technology that improves the quality of life in my community,</li>
                <li>Increasing diversity, representation, and retention of underprivileged talent within the technology industry,</li>
                <li>Improving accessibility and ease of use of technology for everyone.</li>
            </ol>

            <div>
                In my spare time, I enjoy weightlifting/powerlifting, advocating for 
                physical and mental wellness, learning new programming languages and 
                technologies, engaging in many leadership and technical development 
                programs, and meditation.</div>
